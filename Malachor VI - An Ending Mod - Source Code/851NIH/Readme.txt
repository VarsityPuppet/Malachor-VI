This script fires when leaving the Ravager.

If Revan has the dark ending, it will jump straight to 907mal and then to 003EBO, but if Revan was lightsided, then it will jump you to the Telos scene with Carth.

This also sets a global that's required for Malachor to show up on the galaxy map. Once you return to 003EB0, you'll see it there.
