After the Ravager escape, if Revan's ending was lightsided, then the game will go to the Carth cutscene. After it is finished, it will warp to a cutscene of Kreia and Sion in the Trayus Core and then back to the Ebon Hawk. 

The modified script says "a_901jump" but it's really jumping to 907 and then ultimately to 003EBO.
