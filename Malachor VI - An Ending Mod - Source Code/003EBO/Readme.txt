These are some of the files required to run the Malachor Travel cutscene on the Hawk.

These particular files overwrite certain 003EBO files, but can be thrown in the override folder, since they all have unique names. That's what I've been doing, and I've been having no problems.


Instructions - 

Put the StreamVoice folder under 003



Put all of the compiled scripts into the override.


Put 003EBO_loc.mod in the lips folder, or put the individual lip files into the override.
