This module for the most part is done except for I can't get the Remote to fly away at the end of the cutscene, should you decide to make him go at it alone. I've tried everything and no luck.


I think it might actually be something wrong with the UTC of the Remote itself, so I was going to try to modify that when I get to it.

Updates since last time:

I miraculously got the Remote to run off if you choose not to accompany it.

I fixed the Trigger size of the Remote/BaoDur Trigger in the .git


Miscellaneous stuff:

I started adding waypoints for the something I was calling the "Trial of 100 Jedi". Not sure if I'm going to implement though.
