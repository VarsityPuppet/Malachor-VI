Changes:

Visman has been changed. Some voice overs have been edited and re-arranged.
Implement those new camera angles you told me about in this one here.


The G0t0/Remote/HK scene is scripted to work. All it needs is camera angles as well. It is scripted to run after the 903ambush scene, just when exactly it runs depends on your choices with the Remote's mission.


1 - Accompanying the Remote: If you accompany the remote, it will play right after the 903ambush scene.


2 - Not accompanying the remote: After 903ambush, it will load 901mal and you'll have to go through the whole mission before it will load the G0t0/HK/Remote scene.


Note: I've not scripted it to disallow the remote from following you into the Academy. I'll do that eventually...
