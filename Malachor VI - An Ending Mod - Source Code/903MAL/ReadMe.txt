Changes:


So far, 903mal is only scripted to run 1 cutscene.

This cutscene is the party ambush scene I put together. It needs some camera angles of course :).



The rest will be scripted later, after I figure out the Party attacks Kreia sequence in either 904 or 907mal.



ONE THING THAT YOU SHOULD KNOW BEFORE YOU INSTALL THE FILES IS THAT I THINK THERE IS SOMETHING WRONG WITH 903AMBUSH.DLG.

The conversation will freeze on random conversation nodes, no matter the creatures in the module, the size of the module or well.. anything, for that matter.

It may just my xbox, but I believe something is corrupting the dialog file, and I'm not sure if it's my computer or what, so be careful is all. 

If you would like to, you may try recreating the file from scratch: It's not hard you would just have to copy the entries into a clean file.
