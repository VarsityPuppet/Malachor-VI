This is a modified version of 907TEL is actually from the TSLRCM... 

No, I'm not going to steal it, I've just been using it as a placeholder for the scenes I'm going to put there instead.

They'll basically be the same, but I want to change some things so they look a little less strange.

Just put te 907mal.mod into your override and it should all work wonderfully.
