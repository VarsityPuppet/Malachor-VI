The changes this time around are many

dialogs-

I added some 'nicer' options to the t3mal dialog

I added the security camera logs, complete with party member cutscenes

Fixed the lift dialog conditional not working right (but not the way it repairs)

uh... actually, I guess that's it


-----------------------------------------------------------

Added since last time:


Fixed the Lift repair options (Activating lift would sometimes disappear}

T3's dialog fixed (a local was not setting to access the second part of his dialog)

Using the lift now warps to 902mal to run the Visas/Mandalore cutscene. Conditionals not set in place for if Visas is dead though

Changed the Lift repair script condtional to a custom script
