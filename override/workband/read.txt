Here's my proposal for the pre dialog naming agreement:

Dialog name: "pre"+MODULE_NAME
object that starts the dialog: MODULE_NUMBER+"dlghost"

MODULE_NAME is for example 905mal
MODULE_NUMBER is for example 905

Example names are:
pre905mal.dlg
905dlghost

That's how the node is currently scripted in MP_control.nss
